**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
The pages site looks plain and ugly.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In order to make the meeting minutes easier to read we should implement CSS!

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
We could reinvent the wheel with Javascript libraries that emulate CSS or, better yet, create a browser within the browser and then style with that browser! Costly and hard.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
